Week 4 Review

Schedulers Evaluated:
- Round Robin (RR)
- Proportional Fair (PF)
- Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Key Findings:
- DQN achieved the highest throughput.
- PPO achieved high throughput with lower latency than DQN.
- Both DRL methods significantly outperformed baseline schedulers in throughput.
- Fairness dropped to 0.2 for both DRL methods.
- Current reward function strongly favors throughput.

Conclusion:
The DRL pipeline is functional. Future work will focus on reward redesign to improve fairness while maintaining throughput.
